## Development Notes

### Current Status
- Project initialized with basic structure
- Need to implement phases sequentially for best results
- Focus on Phase 1 architecture first before moving to UI enhancements

### Key Priorities
1. **Phase 1** - Critical foundation work (path aliases, folder structure, dependencies)
2. **Phase 2** - User experience improvements (animations, accessibility)
3. **Phase 3** - Core functionality (auth, bookings, payments)
4. **Phase 4** - Production readiness (performance, security, testing)
5. **Phase 5** - Launch preparation (polish, deployment)

### Next Steps
Start with Phase 1 tasks in order:
1. Update tsconfig.json with path aliases
2. Refactor folder structure
3. Install dependencies
4. Set up Gluestack UI
5. Continue with remaining Phase 1 tasks
